Simple blog application
========================

This is a simple project, just for fun.  Some experiments with javascript technologies.

Right now, here are the various goals I intend to accomplish in this project:

* simple blog functionality for a single user (some admin panel where the user can add/preview posts). Posts will be written in markdown
* it should be a SPA (single page application) with client side routing, nodejs backend, some simple db for blog posts. 
* very light: no framework at all (at least, from the point of view of the client), pure javascript as much as possible, no reactjs, no bootstrap, ...
